    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It takes just two ingredients to make these impressive but easy-to-do French pastries, which are often called palm leaves. —Taste of Home Test Kitchen, Milwaukee, Wisconsin</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup sugar, divided</li>
      <li>
        1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°. Sprinkle a surface with 1/4 cup sugar; unfold puff pastry sheet on surface. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar. Roll into a 14x10-in. rectangle. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar to within 1/2 in. of edges. Lightly press into pastry.</li>
        <li>With a knife, very lightly score a line crosswise across the middle of the pastry. Starting at a short side, roll up jelly-roll style, stopping at the score mark in the middle. Starting at the other side, roll up pastry jelly-roll style to score mark. Freeze until firm, 20-30 minutes. Cut into 3/8-in. slices.</li>
        <li>Place cut side up 2 in. apart on parchment-lined baking sheets; sprinkle lightly with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake for 8 minutes. Turn pastries over and sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake until golden brown and glazed, about 3 minutes longer. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Store in airtight containers.</li>
    </ol>
